# Introduction

Iniz is a state library that brings reactivity to ReactJS.

## Motivation

ReactJS is a view library that uses "Push" strategy to detect changes and apply to actual DOM.

For developers to "push" state through components, different patterns such as HOC, render-props, Context are introduced.
These top-down approaches all have different drawbacks such as extra re-renders and "Provider Hell".

Iniz takes a different approach by treating ReactJS "Component"" as "Effect" and variable update as "Exception" in FP.

## How it works

When a ReactJS "Component" is first rendered, Iniz collects its dependencies automatically and trigger re-render when the dependencies are updated.

Below is a basic counter example to give you a taste of how it looks like:

<SandpackEditor
  template="react-ts"
  dependencies={{ "@iniz/react": "*" }}
>

```tsx
import { atom } from "@iniz/react";

const counter = atom(0);
const decrement = () => counter(counter() - 1);
const increment = () => counter(counter() + 1);

function Counter() {
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={decrement}>-</button>
      {counter()}
      <button onClick={increment}>+</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```

</SandpackEditor>
